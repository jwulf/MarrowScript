# Changelog

All notable changes to `marrowscript-compiler` are documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **`relation X: belongs_to Y` now generates working SQL.** Previously the
  lowering created an `IRRelation` that referenced an `<entity>_id` column
  in a FOREIGN KEY constraint without ever adding that column to the model.
  Generated migrations rejected with `column "seller_id" referenced in
  foreign key constraint does not exist` unless users manually duplicated
  the FK column in `owns:`. Now the lowering synthesizes the FK column
  (uuid, NOT NULL, indexed) for every `belongs_to`. If a user already
  declared the column, their declaration wins.
- **Prisma type mapping** (`emit_prisma.ts`):
  - `uint` and `int` no longer use the invalid `Int @db.BigInt` combination.
    They now map to plain `Int` (Postgres `INTEGER`).
  - `updated_at` columns now have `@default(now()) @updatedAt` instead of
    just `@updatedAt`. The previous output failed at INSERT time because
    `@updatedAt` only fires on update.
- **SQLite `RETURNING *` shim** (`emit_sqlite.ts`):
  - The shim previously assumed `params[0]` held the row id for both INSERT
    and UPDATE. UPDATEs from the capability emitter use the shape
    `UPDATE t SET col = $1 WHERE id = $2`, so re-selecting by `params[0]`
    returned no rows. Fixed by parsing the WHERE clause for the id param.
  - The placeholder translator was a naive `$N → ?` regex replacement that
    broke when SQL referenced placeholders out of order
    (`UPDATE t SET name = $2 WHERE id = $1`). Now rewrites the params array
    to match the new placeholder order.
- **SQLite `transaction()` no longer silently fails for async work.**
  better-sqlite3 transactions are synchronous, and the previous wrapper
  passed an `async () => ...` callback that returned an unresolved promise
  to `db.transaction()` — the transaction would commit before any async
  work finished. The wrapper now warns about this in the JSDoc and only
  awaits captured promises *after* the transaction commits, with a clear
  comment that async work runs outside the transaction.
- **Webhook URL validation now actually checks for SSRF**
  (`emit_notify.ts`). The comment claimed "reject loopback / RFC1918 /
  link-local" but only the protocol was checked. Now blocks
  `localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`,
  `192.168.0.0/16`, `169.254.0.0/16` (link-local / cloud metadata),
  IPv6 loopback `::1`, link-local `fe80::/10`, and unique-local
  `fc00::/7`. Set `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1` to opt out (e.g. for
  internal CI setups).

### Changed
- **SQLite target rebranded as schema-only.** The previous output claimed
  to be a "self-contained backend" but only emitted migrations and a DB
  client — `npm run dev` and `npm run start` failed because there was no
  `src/index.ts` or routes. The generated `package.json` now only includes
  `migrate` script + better-sqlite3 / dotenv / uuid dependencies, and the
  README is updated to describe what's actually produced. A future release
  will add full route generation that emits SQLite-compatible SQL.
- **`marrowc validate` auto-detects** the output directory if no path is
  passed. Looks for `output/`, `output-sqlite/`, `output-nakama/` (in that
  order) and uses the first one with a `tsconfig.json`.
- **CLI rejects `--no-sdk` / `--no-openapi` / `--no-seed` for non-Express
  targets** instead of silently ignoring them.
- **CLI help text clarifies which targets are complete vs schema-only.**

### Tests
- New `test_prisma.ts` runs `npx prisma validate` and `npx prisma format`
  against the generated schema. Catches the type-mapping bugs above.
- New `test_relations.ts` verifies `belongs_to` generates working SQL
  across Postgres, SQLite, and Prisma — including a live SQLite test that
  inserts records with FK references and confirms FK enforcement.
- `test_sqlite.ts` now exercises the actual generated `db.ts` with
  RETURNING * in both UPDATE shapes (capability and runtime). Previously
  step 8 was a string-grep that didn't catch the param-index bug.

### Notes for downstream consumers
- The `belongs_to` fix changes the IR shape in a backward-compatible way.
  Existing `.marrow` files that manually duplicate the FK column in `owns:`
  continue to work — the synthesizer skips columns that are already
  declared.
- The Prisma fix means `int @db.BigInt` is no longer emitted. If you were
  relying on the (broken) BigInt mapping, bump your tolerated integer size
  in your application code, or wait for a future release that adds an
  explicit `@db.bigint` annotation in MarrowScript syntax.
- The SQLite target is now explicitly schema-only. If you were generating
  with `--target sqlite` and trying to run the result, switch to the
  default Express target until full SQLite route generation lands.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **SQLite target** (`--target sqlite`). Generates a self-contained backend
  with no external services — no Postgres, no Redis, no Docker. The whole
  database is one file. Includes a `better-sqlite3` driver, schema migrations,
  audit log, and event outbox. Ideal for local development, demos, and small
  single-node deployments. Run:
  ```bash
  marrowc compile app.marrow --target sqlite
  cd output-sqlite && npm install && npm run migrate && npm run dev
  ```
  The DB client wraps `better-sqlite3` and translates Postgres-style `$N`
  placeholders to `?`, with `RETURNING *` emulation, so the same generated
  route handlers work across both targets.
- **Webhook notification provider** (`NOTIFY_PROVIDER=webhook`). Posts event
  payloads as `application/json` to `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`. Sets
  `X-MarrowScript-Event` and an `X-MarrowScript-Signature` header (HMAC-SHA256
  of the body when `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set). Receivers can verify
  authenticity with the same secret. Rejects non-`http(s)` URLs.
- **React hooks SDK** (`sdk/react.ts`). Generated alongside `sdk/client.ts`
  whenever the SDK target runs. Provides typed hooks: `useList<Entity>`,
  `use<Entity>(id)`, `useCreate<Entity>`, `useUpdate<Entity>`,
  `useDelete<Entity>`, plus `useCapability<Name>` for each capability.
  Includes an `<ApiProvider>` for client injection. Zero external
  dependencies — uses React's built-in `useState` / `useEffect` so consumers
  pick their own data layer (react-query, SWR, plain).

### Tests
- `test_sqlite.ts` boots a real SQLite database, runs the generated
  migrations, and exercises CRUD via `better-sqlite3` (15 assertions).
- `test_notify.ts` spins a mock HTTP server, points the webhook at it, and
  verifies HMAC signing, header propagation, and URL validation
  (14 assertions).
- `test_react.ts` runs `tsc --noEmit` against the generated `react.ts` with
  real React types installed, and asserts every hook is emitted (18
  assertions).
- All previous tests continue to pass.

### Notes for downstream consumers
- The SQLite target output goes to `output-sqlite/` (siblling of `output/`)
  so it doesn't conflict with the default Express target.
- `sdk/react.ts` is only emitted when `--no-sdk` is not set.
- The webhook provider does not retry on its own — pair with `EVENT_MODE=durable`
  if you need at-least-once delivery semantics.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Prisma schema emitter** (`--target prisma`). Compiles `.marrow` files to a
  complete `prisma/schema.prisma` with proper type mappings, `@id`, `@default`,
  `@unique`, `@updatedAt`, native type annotations (`@db.Uuid`,
  `@db.Timestamptz`, etc.), relation directives, junction table models for
  many-to-many, and infrastructure models (`AuditLog`, `EventOutbox`).
  Usage: `marrowc compile app.marrow --target prisma`
- **`marrowc validate [dir]` command.** Runs `tsc --noEmit` against a generated
  output directory to verify the generated TypeScript compiles cleanly. Useful
  for CI pipelines. Exits with code 1 on type errors.
- `PrismaEmitter` exported from the public API for programmatic use.

### Notes for downstream consumers
- The `prisma` target is additive — it does not affect the default `express`
  target output. Use `--target prisma` to get a standalone Prisma schema
  alongside (or instead of) the full Express project.
- `marrowc validate` requires `npm install` to have been run in the output
  directory first (it needs `node_modules/` for type resolution).

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-16

### Repo hygiene
- Untracked `compiler/dist/` from git. The build now happens automatically:
  - On `npm install` of `file:../compiler` from sibling packages (lsp, vscode-ext)
    via a new `prepare` lifecycle script.
  - On `npm publish` via the existing `prepublishOnly` script.
  - On a fresh clone, contributors get the build by running `npm install` in
    any consuming package or by running `npm run build` in `compiler/`.
- Fixed the `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` URLs in `compiler/package.json`
  — they pointed at a stale `dantheman181/marrowscript` GitHub URL. Now point at
  the actual repo, `Doorman11991/MarrowScript`. The npm package metadata for
  v0.6.2 reflects this; users on v0.6.1 will see the wrong URLs in `npm view`
  output but the package contents are otherwise identical.
- Rewrote `.gitignore` to use ASCII section separators instead of mojibaked
  UTF-8 box-drawing characters.

### Notes for downstream consumers
- No code changes. The published tarball contents are identical to 0.6.1
  except for the metadata fields above. Upgrading is purely cosmetic.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-16

### Security
- **V-9** Hardened the generated notification service (`emit_notify.ts`).
  Event payloads are now HTML-escaped before being interpolated into email
  bodies so a payload value like `<script>...` cannot break out of the
  `<pre>` block. Recipient addresses are validated against a conservative
  regex that also rejects `\r` / `\n`, preventing header injection into the
  Resend / SendGrid request bodies.

### Repo hygiene
- Untracked `examples/*/output/node_modules/` from git. The vendor tree was
  historically committed; `.gitignore` already excluded it but the existing
  files remained in git history. The fresh `npm install` in the example now
  reports zero advisories, and Dependabot alerts against stale vendored
  versions clear up.
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-16

Twelve security fixes scored by priority and effort, plus DSL additions for
ownership predicates and field-level data classification. All 56 + 7 compiler
tests pass, deterministic compilation holds, the regenerated marketplace
example type-checks cleanly, and `npm audit` reports zero vulnerabilities.

### Added
- **`caller` built-in** for capability preconditions. Resolves to the
  authenticated actor's id (`auth.actor_id`) so the DSL can express ownership
  checks directly:
  ```bone
  capability publish_listing(seller: Seller, listing: Listing) {
    requires: [
      caller.id == seller.id,
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
- **`@sensitive` field annotation.** Marks PII / secret fields so the audit
  middleware redacts them before persisting request bodies to
  `audit_log.payload`.
  ```bone
  entity Buyer {
    owns: [
      email: string @sensitive,
      payment_token: string @sensitive,
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
- Generated `<Entity>CreateSchema` and `<Entity>UpdateSchema` Zod derivatives,
  wired into POST and PUT route handlers.
- `app.set('trust proxy', ...)` in the generated index, with a `TRUST_PROXY`
  environment override.

### Changed
- **JWT verification is now algorithm-pinned.** `jwt.verify(token, secret, {
  algorithms: ['HS256'], maxAge: '1h' })` plus a strict check that `decoded.sub`
  is a non-empty string. Closes the algorithm-confusion class of attacks.
- **WebSocket auth uses the same secret-loading rules as HTTP**: refuse-to-start
  in production if `JWT_SECRET` is unset, warn in dev, pin algorithms.
- **PUT routes derive an updatable-column allow-list** from the IR model and
  reject unknown keys with HTTP 400 `UNKNOWN_FIELDS`. Closes the
  SQL-identifier-injection path where `Object.keys(req.body)` was previously
  interpolated as identifiers into `UPDATE SET`.
- **Admin panel (`emit_admin.ts`) was rewritten** to use `createElement` and
  `textContent` for every API-derived value. All `innerHTML` and inline
  `onclick=` handlers removed. Closes the stored-XSS path that would have
  leaked the admin bearer token from `localStorage`.
- **Audit middleware now redacts** `@sensitive` fields plus an always-redact
  list of common credential names (`password`, `token`, `api_key`, `ssn`,
  `card_number`, etc.).
- **`/health/metrics` is now restricted** to a `METRICS_TOKEN` bearer or
  RFC1918 / loopback source IPs. Returns 403 otherwise.
- **`trace_id` is server-generated.** A client-supplied `X-Trace-Id` header is
  only honored if it parses as a UUID, preventing forged correlation IDs in
  audit and event records.
- **Dependency versions bumped** in `emitPackageJson`:
  - `express` 4.18.2 → 4.22.2 (CVE-2024-29041, qs / path-to-regexp DoS)
  - `ws` 8.16.0 → 8.18.0 (CVE-2024-37890)
  - `helmet` 7.1.0 → 8.0.0
  - `pg` 8.11.3 → 8.13.1
  - `ioredis` 5.3.2 → 5.4.1
  - `uuid` 9.0.0 → 10.0.0
  - `zod` (new) 3.23.8
  - Type packages bumped to match.

### Fixed
- Duplicate-emission of model schemas in `emit_zod.ts` — the same model
  appearing in both an `api_service` and its backing `data_store` module was
  being emitted twice, causing `Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable` errors.
  Same dedupe pattern as the previous fix in `emit_full.ts`.
- `getAuditLog()` was treating `query()`'s return value as `{ rows }` instead
  of the array it actually returns.
- `examples/marketplace/output/.env` was tracked in git despite being listed
  in `.gitignore`. Removed via `git rm --cached`.

### Notes for downstream consumers
- This release is the first to depend on `zod` in generated projects. Consumers
  who run `marrowc compile` will see `zod` show up in their generated
  `package.json`.
- The `@renamed_from` and `@sensitive` annotations require parser support
  introduced in this release. `.marrow` files using them will fail to parse on
  v0.5.x.
- The `caller` identifier in capability `requires:` clauses is a new built-in.
  If a `.marrow` file already declared a parameter named `caller`, recompile
  carefully — the built-in shadows the parameter.
