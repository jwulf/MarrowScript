# MarrowScript Language Specification v0.1

## 1. What MarrowScript Is

MarrowScript (Conceptual-Virtual Intent-Based Execution) is a **formal declarative language** 
whose source programs describe software systems as **constrained intent graphs**.

A MarrowScript program is NOT natural language. It is a structured declaration that:
- Has a defined grammar (PEG)
- Operates over a closed ontology of software concepts
- Is compiled through constraint solving (not template matching)
- Produces deterministic, reproducible output for any given input

## 2. Core Insight

The fundamental problem MarrowScript solves:

> Human intent is ambiguous. Software must not be.

MarrowScript bridges this gap NOT by guessing (heuristics) but by:
1. Restricting the input space to a formal grammar
2. Defining a closed ontology of concepts with fixed semantics
3. Using constraint propagation to resolve all ambiguity at compile time
4. Requiring the programmer to resolve any remaining ambiguity explicitly

## 3. Language Properties

| Property | Guarantee |
|----------|-----------|
| Determinism | Same source â†’ identical output (bitwise) |
| Totality | Every valid program compiles to a complete system |
| Soundness | If it compiles, the output satisfies all declared constraints |
| Decidability | Compilation always terminates |
| Minimality | Output contains no components not required by the intent graph |

## 4. What a MarrowScript Program Looks Like

```MarrowScript
system InventoryPlatform {
  domain: multiplayer_game

  entity Item {
    owns: [name: string, quantity: uint, metadata: map]
    constraints: [quantity >= 0, name.length in 1..128]
    states: available -> reserved -> consumed | deleted
  }

  entity Player {
    owns: [username: string, inventory: set<Item>]
    constraints: [username.unique, inventory.size <= 1000]
    auth: jwt
  }

  capability trade(from: Player, to: Player, item: Item) {
    requires: [from.inventory contains item, item.state == available]
    effects: [
      item.owner = to,
      from.inventory -= item,
      to.inventory += item
    ]
    emits: TradeCompleted
    sync: realtime
  }

  channel lobby {
    transport: websocket
    ordering: causal
    participants: set<Player>
    persistence: last_100
  }
}
```

This is NOT pseudocode. Every token has formal semantics defined in this spec.

## 7. Cognition Layer (LLM Harness)

MarrowScript ships an additive cognition layer for orchestrating weak/small language models (1B–8B) deterministically. Adding a `model`, `prompt`, `router`, or `cognition:` modifier to a `.marrow` file activates the harness emitters; without them, the language compiles exactly as it does for non-cognition projects.

The harness is constrained by construction:

- **Models** are declared with typed budgets and provider adapters (`ollama`, `openai_compat`, `llamacpp`, `koboldcpp`, `http`).
- **Prompts** are typed contracts with structured validation, bounded retry, optional repair, and an optional cache.
- **Routers** are deterministic decision trees over an explicit ordered tier ladder. Same input → same tier.
- **Cognition primitives** (`vote`, `semantic_slice`, `compress_context`, etc.) are drawn from a closed catalog. The compiler never invents new ones.

Non-determinism is confined to model invocation. Every boundary writes a span to `cognition_traces`; replays are reproducible via `marrowc replay <trace_id>`.

See `11_COGNITION_LAYER.md` for the full specification.
